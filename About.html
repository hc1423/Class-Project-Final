    <h2> Background</h2>
    <p>Horizon Drive Rentals was founded by two college friends who shared a passion for road trips and adventure. Tired of the hidden fees, poor customer service, and unreliable vehicles they encountered while traveling, they set out to create a rental car company that prioritized transparency, modern technology, and customer satisfaction. What began as a local startup with a dozen cars in the Southwest has since grown into a nationwide operation.

      The company focuses on convenience-driven services like contactless pickup, flexible drop-off options, and real-time vehicle tracking through a mobile app. Their fleet includes everything from economy cars to electric vehicles and luxury SUVs. Horizon Drive Rentals has also partnered with several eco-conscious initiatives to offer carbon-offset options and a growing number of hybrid and EV models. </p>
